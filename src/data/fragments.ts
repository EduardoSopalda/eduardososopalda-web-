// Shared fragment pool -- previously duplicated between the field and
// the landing would have meant two sources of truth for the same 50
// lines. Extracted here so Field.astro's continuous world and
// Landing.astro's rotating hero quote both read from one place.
//
// "source" is the real article title each fragment was lifted from
// (content/_index.json), not invented — matches fragments.md's own
// arrow-target links, resolved to human-readable titles. Fragments
// tagged "site" in the source file aren't from any article (a line
// about the site itself), so they carry no source and callers just
// omit the reference line for those.
//
// "year" is the real publication year, matched by source title against
// content/_index.json's own date field -- not invented, and left
// unset (never guessed) for the one fragment with no source at all.
// "href" stays unset everywhere: there's no real per-article URL to
// link to yet (see docs/BRIEF.md -- "whether the site publishes first
// or archives from LinkedIn" is still an open question), so the field
// exists in the type for when that's decided, not populated now.
